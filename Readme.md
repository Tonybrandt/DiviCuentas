[DiviCuentas] (https://tonybrandt.github.io/DiviCuentas/) is a web application, designed so that you don't have to worry when at the end of your meeting with friends you have to split the expenses. In just a couple of simple steps, get a summary of the detailed numbers and a small balance report for each of the participants of the meeting. Because we know that clear accounts keep friendships going.

## User's guide

In the first form you must enter the number of people with whom you are going to split the expenses and give a name to the event.
Then you must fill in the name fields with the names of each participant and the expense of each one of them, always followed by their name.
After that, you will be able to see a summary of the meeting, with the total spent and the division of expenses. At the bottom you will see a summary for each participant. Remember to fill in all the fields. The application is limited to a maximum of 10 people. The minimum balances per person must be filled in with 0, it is important not to leave them empty. I hope you have fun doing it :D

```bash
Use the continue button to advance through the forms. 
```

## What I learned

```python
Technologies

# HTML5
# CSS3
# Vanilla JavaScript

I have learned to create, manipulate, iterate and display arrays. 
I had to think and create an algorithm that takes different types of data from a user, 
entered through a form and perform some calculations to be able to show a summary of all the expenses, 
that the users have had and that is according to the information entered. 
The second form is created dynamically with JavaScript according to the information entered by the user. 
Then I use all that information to generate a detailed report.
